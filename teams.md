## Matrix: Element X Web

- **Team Lead**: [@langleyd](https://github.com/langleyd)
- **Members**: [@langleyd](https://github.com/langleyd), [@florianduros](https://github.com/florianduros), [@t3chguy](https://github.com/t3chguy)
- **Idea**: A next generation Element web/desktop client that aims for simplicity, familiarity, reliability and SPEED! The idea is to combine the matrix-rust-sdk(with its new web bindings) and some of latest Element Web UI components like our newly designed room list to give an impression of the future.
